Out there on Ribbonfarm, there is a post titled
[Immortality Begins at 40](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/04/28/immortality-begins-at-forty/).
This is a review/interpretation of that post.

There are a few things you have to find and replace for the post to make sense:

- immortality --> fuck you money
- 40 --> age at which you become immortal
- culture --> societal expectations
- meaning --> advice

> I discovered something a couple of years ago: Almost all culture, old or new, is designed for
> consumption by people under 40. People between 40 and Ω (an indeterminate number defined as
> "really, just way too old"), are primarily employed as meaning-makers for the under-40 set.
> This is because they are mostly good for nothing else, and on average not valuable enough
> themselves for society to invest meaning in.

So for people who get fuck you money, they primariy give advice for people who are not there yet.
Once they get fuck you money, they stop being productive - and it does not make sense for there
to be some advice market for them because they are not going to do anything more.

> The only culture designed for people between 40 and Ω is prescription drug ads and unreadably
> dense literary novels

Usually someone who gets fuck you money is sufficiently old that the targeted advertising shows them
prescription drug ads. They have so much free time, they decide to finally read unreadably dense novels
like Ulysses by James Joyce. This is the societal expectation present on those who managed to get
fuck you money, to spend their time doing something very intellectual.

At this stage in your life, the societal expectation is for you to plan for your death. Leave behind 
a will and so on.

> But there’s a plus side. Forty is when immortality begins.

A very general life-stage map across civilizations and eras looks like this:

- 0 to α: Achieve launch velocity
- α to 40: Play culture!
- 40 to Ω: Ah crap, I have to make shit up for others now?
- Ω to ∅: Let them eat cake

If you’re lucky, the following set of inequalities will hold for you, and you will be able to experience that most 
precious of all things, a life lived forward in time:

- 0 < α: you have childhood innocence to lose
- α < 40: you have enough value that society does culture to you
- 40 < Ω: there is enough time to take revenge for having had culture done to you
- Ω < ∅: if you’re lucky, there will be time to rest and observe in peace

Some well-known fucked-up life scripts include:

- Ω < α: Acting dead
- α  > 40: Peter Pan
- 40 > 40: Has-been
- 40 < 40: Burnout
- ∅ < α: Died tragically and heroically young
- ∅ < ∅: Painful and unwanted life extension

Not only is all advice transient, it must all be manufactured by somebody. Advice doesn’t just happen. Civilization 
functions by putting the 40-to-Ω crowd to work, creating advice for the α-to-40 set to follow.

Examples of advice: "kubernetes will fix all of your problems, and becoming a devops engineer is the _meaning_ of life"

So basically, there is no need to ask anyone for advice, but people do this anyway. Everything is out there on 
the Internet, and there is no overwhelming question in the first place about what you should be doing. The author
calls this meaning because some common rite of passage of the post-rat community is the search for the "meaning
of life".

You give advice on how to become rich by doing some kind of remix of all the advice you have encountered and 
received, or you create brand new advice on how to become rich by finding some brand new alpha.

This alpha steadily decays as more people find out about this. And hence:

> The half-life of a representative basket of meaning is about twenty years, adjusting for purchasing power parity.

> You might conclude from this that if you seek meaning, you will also make money. This is exactly wrong. 
> You have to make meaning games, which is exactly the opposite sort of activity.

Don't seek advice, follow the advice.

Hit the goldilocks zone of how much time to spend assimilating advice from other people, and how much time to 
follow the advice. The code referes to never ending search for the perfect advice to follow.

But all of alpha is based on some secret, some hidden truth that not many people know in the Zero To One Peter Thiel
sense. Therefore, seeking truth is the best way to become immortal. If you do this you will realize there is
no overwhelming question. Everything is clear. You just have to get to work on finding some new truth about the 
universe.

Basically, regardless of what the _meaning of life_ is, or what your invariant [CEV preferences](https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf)
are: to satisfy your preferences, regardless of what the preference is, you have to know what is true and partake
in the activity of discovering new truths.

In some way, this is the only meaningful activity by definition, following straight from whatever axiomatic
preferences you may have. People who are very good at discovering these truths become immortal, either by getting
tenure in academia or getting fuck you money or understanding themselves so well that they have zero confusion
about what to do, like some musician. Even understanding yourself is a form of truth-seeking applied to yourself.

The best option is obviously to find out what is true about yourself. What are your axiomatic preferences that
remain the same across all realities, seek these truths about yourself - find out what you are independent of
society and then take action to satisfy your preferences.

The hard part here is becoming independent of society and getting rid of mimetic desires in some Girardian sense. Who are you 
if you have no one to imitate? What are your desires if you there is no desires you are copying from someone else?

I think this is what works best to become immortal.
